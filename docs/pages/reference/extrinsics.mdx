## Balances

#### Transfer

Sends an amount of native tokens from one account to another on the same network. Uses <code className="vocs_Code">balances.transferKeepAlive</code> under the hood to ensure the sender's account remains above the existential deposit.

## Nomination Pools

#### Claim Rewards

Claims all pending staking rewards from a nomination pool. This calls <code className="vocs_Code">nominationPools.claimPayout</code> to transfer any unclaimed rewards directly to the nominator's account.

#### Compound Rewards

Bonds any unclaimed nomination pool rewards back into the pool, increasing the nominator's stake. This calls <code className="vocs_Code">nominationPools.bondExtra</code>, which automatically claims and bonds pending rewards in a single step.
