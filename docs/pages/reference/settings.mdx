# Settings

## General

<ul className="flex_Col3">
  <SettingItem
    title={<span>Docked Window</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        This setting controls whether the main window is fixed or free-floating.
      </span>
    }
    onText={
      <span>
        The window is docked below the Polkadot Live icon with a fixed size and
        position. You can&apos;t move or resize it.
      </span>
    }
    offText={
      <span>
        The window floats freely and can be moved anywhere on the screen. You
        can also resize it vertically by dragging the top or bottom edges.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <SettingItem
    title={<span>Enable Polkassembly Data</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        This setting controls whether proposal metadata is fetched from the
        Polkassembly API for display in the OpenGov window.
      </span>
    }
    onText={
      <span>
        Referenda listings will include proposal titles and descriptions, as
        seen on portals like Polkassembly and Subsquare. This lets you read
        metadata directly in Polkadot Live without visiting external sites.
      </span>
    }
    offText={
      <span>
        Metadata is not fetched. Listings will show only on-chain data (e.g.
        proposal ID and track). You&apos;ll need to click a portal link to view
        full details on an external site. Rendering may be faster with this
        option.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <SettingItem
    title={<span>Hide Dock Icon (macOS)</span>}
    description={

  />
  <SettingItem
    title={<span>Show On All Workspaces (macOS)</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Controls whether Polkadot Live windows appear in all macOS workspaces or
        just one.
      </span>
    }
    onText={
      <span>
        The main window and open views are visible in every workspace.
      </span>
    }
    offText={
      <span>
        Windows appear only in the workspace where Polkadot Live was opened.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <SettingItem
    title={<span>Silence OS Notifications</span>}
    description={

        Live.
      </span>
    }
    onText={
      <span>Native notifications are disabled throughout the application.</span>
    }
    offText={
      <span>
        Native notifications are active. Individual subscription settings
        determine if their notifications are shown.

        All available subscriptions are enabled by default when an account is
        imported.
      </span>
    }
    offText={
      <span>
        No subscriptions are enabled automatically. You&apos;ll need to manage
        them manually via the account&apos;s subscription settings.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <SettingItem
    title={<span>Keep Outdated Events</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Controls whether older event items remain visible when a new event is
        received for the same subscription.
      </span>
    }
    onText={
      <span>
        Old event items are kept in the UI. This allows you to track historical
        events for each subscription.

        A debugging category appears in the main window&apos;s subscriptions
        screen. You can select a chain to enable debugging subscriptions, such
        as retrieving the latest timestamp and current slot. These help verify
        that your system can fetch real-time data from the network.
      </span>
    }
    offText={
      <span>The debugging category is hidden from the main window.</span>
    }
  />
</ul>
