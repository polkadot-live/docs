# Settings

## General

#### Docked Window

This setting controls whether the main window is fixed or free-floating.

- <span className="textAccent">On</span>
  The window is docked below the Polkadot Live icon with a fixed size and
  position. You can't move or resize it.
- <span className="textAccent">Off</span>
  The window floats freely and can be moved anywhere on the screen. You can also
  resize it vertically by dragging the top or bottom edges.

#### Enable Polkassembly Data

This setting controls whether proposal metadata is fetched from the Polkassembly API for display in the OpenGov window.

- <span className="textAccent">On</span>
  Referenda listings will include proposal titles as seen on portals like
  Polkassembly and Subsquare. This lets you read metadata directly in Polkadot
  Live without visiting external sites.
- <span className="textAccent">Off</span>
  Metadata is not fetched. Listings will show only on-chain data (e.g. proposal
  ID and track). You&apos;ll need to click a portal link to view full details on
  an external site. Rendering may be faster with this option.

#### Hide Dock Icon (macOS)

Controls whether the Polkadot Live icon appears in the macOS dock.

- <span className="textAccent">On</span>
  The app icon is hidden from the dock.
- <span className="textAccent">Off</span>
  The app icon is visible in the dock.

#### Show On All Workspaces (macOS)

Controls whether Polkadot Live windows appear in all macOS workspaces or just one.

- <span className="textAccent">On</span>
  The main window and open views are visible in every workspace.
- <span className="textAccent">Off</span>
  Windows appear only in the workspace where Polkadot Live was opened.

#### Silence OS Notifications

Globally controls whether native OS notifications are shown in Polkadot Live.

- <span className="textAccent">On</span>
  Native notifications are disabled throughout the application.
- <span className="textAccent">Off</span>
  Native notifications are active. Individual subscription settings determine if
  their notifications are shown.

## Subscriptions

#### Enable Automatic Subscriptions

Controls whether all available subscriptions are automatically enabled when importing an account.

- <span className="textAccent">On</span>
  All available subscriptions are enabled by default when an account is
  imported.
- <span className="textAccent">Off</span>
  No subscriptions are enabled automatically. You&apos;ll need to manage them
  manually via the account&apos;s subscription settings.

#### Keep Outdated Events

Controls whether older event items remain visible when a new event is received for the same subscription.

- <span className="textAccent">On</span>
  Old event items are kept in the UI. This allows you to track historical events
  for each subscription.
- <span className="textAccent">Off</span>
  Old event items are removed when a new event is received for the same
  subscription and account.

#### Show Debugging Subscriptions

Controls whether the Debugging category is visible in the **Account Subscriptions** tab of the main window.

- <span className="textAccent">On</span>A debugging category appears in the main
  window's account subscriptions screen. You can select a chain to enable
  debugging subscriptions, such as retrieving the latest timestamp and current
  slot. These help verify that your system can fetch real-time data from the
  network.
- <span className="textAccent">Off</span>
  The debugging category is hidden from the main window.
