# Subscriptions

Polkadot Live's subscription system provides flexible, customizable ways to stay informed about on-chain activity across multiple networks and accounts. Subscriptions allow users to monitor events ranging from account balances and staking activity to governance referenda and nomination pool updates.

There are three main types of subscriptions:

- **Chain event subscriptions**<br />
  Dispatch events as they occur on-chain, with the ability to scope subscriptions globally to the entire network, to specific accounts, or to individual referenda. These provide highly granular, real-time insights into blockchain activity.

- **Automatic subscriptions**<br />
  Trigger notifications immediately when tracked on-chain data changes, providing real-time updates for fast-moving events such as balance changes or staking activity.

- **Interval subscriptions**<br />
  Deliver periodic updates at configurable intervals, ideal for slower-moving metrics like ongoing referenda or threshold values.

Each subscription generates detailed event items in the app, and users can optionally receive native OS notifications for instant alerts. The following reference pages provide detailed information about the events available for each subscription type.
