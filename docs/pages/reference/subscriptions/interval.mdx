# Interval Subscriptions

Interval subscriptions provide periodic updates for on-chain data, delivering notifications at configurable intervals rather than in real time. These subscriptions are ideal for tracking slower-moving metrics where immediate updates are not required, such as governance referenda or other time-sensitive, but non-instantaneous events.

This reference lists all currently supported interval subscriptions, organized by category.
