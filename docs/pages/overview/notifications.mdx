# Notifications

Polkadot Live offers a flexible notification system powered by subscriptions, allowing you to monitor on-chain activity across accounts, governance, and staking. Notifications are delivered both as **native OS notifications** and as **event items** within the app's main window. These event items often include helpful links to external tools like **Subscan** or the **Staking Dashboard**, depending on the notification type.

## Subscription types

There are currently two main types of subscriptions in Polkadot Live, with support for on-demand previews as well:

<ul className="flex_Col1">
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Automatic subscriptions</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        These trigger notifications immediately when a tracked on-chain value
        changes. For example, if a balance subscription is active for an
        account, you&apos;ll be notified as soon as that account sends or
        receives funds.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Interval subscriptions</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        These are ideal for tracking slower-moving metrics, such as OpenGov
        referenda. You can configure a custom interval (e.g. every 60 minutes)
        to receive updates, such as the latest Aye/Nay vote percentages on a
        referendum.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>One-shot previews</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Some subscriptions can be previewed by clicking a &quot;one-shot&quot;
        button. This gives you a real-time look at the event data without
        enabling continuous tracking.
      </span>
    }
  />
</ul>

## Available subscriptions

Polkadot Live supports subscriptions for a variety of data types across Substrate-based chains, including:

<ul className="flex_Col1">
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Account metrics</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Track free, frozen, reserved, and spendable balances for any imported
        account.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Staking activity</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Get updates on staking rewards, validator exposure, commission changes,
        and more—whether you&apos;re staking directly or via a pool.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>OpenGov activity</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Follow key metrics from referenda, including vote counts and and
        referenda listings.
      </span>
    }
  />
</ul>

Subscriptions are available for both fully controlled and read-only accounts, allowing you to monitor on-chain activity even if you don't control the private key.

## Notification delivery

Whenever a subscription is triggered, an **event item** is always created and displayed in the main window. These items often include contextual links for deeper inspection—such as to **Subscan**, the **Staking Dashboard**, or **OpenGov portals**, depending on the type of event.

In addition to in-app event items, Polkadot Live can also display **native OS notifications** in your desktop environment. These alerts are optional and fully configurable:

<ul className="flex_Col1">
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Globally</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Toggle native OS notifications on or off for the entire app. They are
        enabled by default.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Per subscription</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Each subscription has its own setting to control whether a native
        notification is shown when triggered.
      </span>
    }
  />
</ul>

This gives you fine-grained control over how you stay informed—whether through quiet in-app updates, desktop alerts, or both.

## Looking ahead

The number and variety of available subscriptions is expected to grow as Polkadot Live continues to evolve. This will offer even more fine-grained ways to stay informed about activity across your accounts and networks.
