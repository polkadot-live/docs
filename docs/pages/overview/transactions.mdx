# Transactions

Polkadot Live provides a streamlined and elegant way to submit extrinsics (transactions) to supported Substrate-based networks. This functionality is designed to be fast, non-intrusive, and integrated smoothly. Currently, submitting extrinsics is fully supported for accounts imported via Ledger hardware wallets, wallets supporting the WalletConnect protocol, and the Polkadot Vault application.

## Submitting transactions

The process of submitting a transaction is handled entirely within the Polkadot Live interface. When you perform actions such as setting up token transfers or interacting with staking features, a pending extrinsic (transaction) is added to the **Extrinsics** window.

Each extrinsic can be reviewed before submission. The **Extrinsics** window provides a summary dialog for each transaction with details such as:

<ul className="flex_Col1">
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Pallet and method name</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        For example: <code>balances.transferKeepAlive</code>, indicating the
        pallet and function being called.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Estimated transaction fee</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Displayed in the network&apos;s native token; this is the cost to
        process the transaction.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Signing method</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        The tool used to sign the transactionâ€”e.g., Ledger, WalletConnect, or
        Polkadot Vault.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Transaction-specific information</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Details like the sender&apos;s address and any relevant parameters
        specific to the extrinsic.
      </span>
    }
  />
</ul>

## Signing transactions

Each extrinsic in the list includes a **Sign** button. When clicked, Polkadot Live opens a signing overlay tailored to the signing account and its import method:

<ul className="flex_Col1">
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Polkadot Vault</span>}
    description={<span>a QR-based signing flow is shown.</span>}
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Ledger</span>}
    description={<span>A USB-based signing prompt is displayed.</span>}
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>WalletConnect</span>}
    description={
      <span>A session-based flow is triggered with your connected wallet.</span>
    }
  />
</ul>

Throughout the signing process, your private keys remain safely on your device or hardware wallet. Polkadot Live only facilitates the signing and submission.

## Filtering & managing transactions

The Extrinsics window offers several tools to manage your transactions efficiently:

<ul className="flex_Col1">
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Status filters</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Filter transactions by status such as <b>Pending</b>, <b>In-Block</b>,{' '}
        <b>Finalized</b>, <b>Error</b>, or <b>Submitted</b>.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Account filter</span>}
    description={
      <span>
        Lets you view only the transactions associated with a specific account.
      </span>
    }
  />
  <DetailItem
    title={<span>Delete option</span>}
    description={<span>You may also delete a transaction to remove it.</span>}
  />
</ul>

After signing and submitting a transaction, its status will update in real time as it progresses on the blockchain. Once finalized, you can use the **Block Explorer** button to view granular information about the transaction in an external explorer.

## Typical transaction flow

::::steps

#### Step 1

Create a pending transaction by interacting with a UI.

#### Step 2

Review the transaction in the **Extrinsics** window.

#### Step 3

Click **Sign** to begin the signing process (or delete it if no longer needed).

#### Step 4

Complete the signing flow based on the signing account's sign method.

#### Step 5

Wait for confirmation as the extrinsic is submitted and finalized on-chain.

#### Step 6

Inspect the extrinsic in a block explorer via the transaction's block explorer menu item.
